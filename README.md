# Phaser UI Tools
I really wanted a viewport with a scrollbar. Things escalated.

### Getting Started
Get phaser-ui-tools.js or phaser-ui-tools.min.js from the dist directory and add it to your project's index.html.
It should look something like:
```
<script src="lib/phaser-ui-tools.min.js"></script>
```
